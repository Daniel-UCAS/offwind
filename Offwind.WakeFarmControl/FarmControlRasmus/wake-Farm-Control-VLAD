Description on the Wake-Farm-Control

Variables that the end-user should be able to alter:
The Syntax is as follows
Matlab Variable Name, "What it should be called on Homepage" (Short Desciption on mouseover)

"True or False"-settings:
enablePowerDistribution "Enable Power Distribution?" (Enables wind farm control and not only constant power)
enableTurbineDynamics "Enable Turbine Dynamics?" (Enable Dynamic Turbine Model)
powerRefInterpolation "Enable Power Reference Interpolation" (Enable Power Reference Interpolation)
enableVaryingDemand "Enable a Varying Demand" (Enables a Power Demand that varies).

Variables that the user should be able to set:
simParm.timeStep "Time Step" (time Step)
simParm.tEnd "End Time" (end time of simulation)
simParm.ctrlUpdate "Update Interval, Control" (update time of controller)
simParm.powerUpdate "Update Interval, Power" (update time of the power reference)
P_demand(1) "Initial Power Demand" (The initial Power demand, if the varying demand option is set to "false" this will remain constant throughout the simulation).


Outputs:
Allow the users to download the "dataOut" structure. This contains the following:
[time, sumPower, sumReference, sumAvailable] - so the
