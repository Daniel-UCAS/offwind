        <p>
            The flow of wind between windmills is influenced by other windmills – both on a small and large scale wind farm.
            So predicting the interaction between wind farms and turbines becomes important for optimized wind energy 
            production or large installations offshore.

        <p>
            With Advanced Tools you can utilize a power of CFD simulations. Offwind CFD tools are based on OpenFOAM standard solvers. The simulations are being
            run at our backend servers in fully parallel mode thus providing optimal performance for most CFD tasks.
