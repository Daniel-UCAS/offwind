        <h1>Wind Farm Power Calculator</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this tool is to calculate simple windwave
            interactions by take into account the effect of the waves on the
            wind speed.</p>
        <p>The vertical profile of wind speed with height in neutral stability
            condition is given by:<br/>
            <img src="/static/eng-tools/wind-wave/formula-1.PNG" class="img-polaroid" width="50%"/>
            </p>
        <p>Where:<br/>
            <span class="formula">U<sub>z</sub></span> - is the horizontal wind speed at the height Z above the ocean surface;<br/>
            <span class="formula">u<sub>*</sub></span> - is the friction velocity;<br/>
            <span class="formula">k</span> - is the von Kármán constant;<br/>
            <span class="formula">Z<sub>0</sub></span> - is aerodynamic roughness length.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>The effects of the wave field on the wind vertical profile are
            represented by the lumped constant <span class="formula">Z<sub>0</sub></span>. Usually this constant is
            calculated by using Charnock expression for the aerodynamic roughness
            height [1]:<br/>
            <img src="/static/eng-tools/wind-wave/formula-2.PNG" class="img-polaroid" width="50%"/>
        </p>
        <p>Where <span class="formula">g</span> is the acceleration of gravity, and <span class="formula">&alpha;</span> is known as Charnock
            constant which is given the value of 0.012 by Charnock. The Charnock
            expression doesn’t include the effect of the wave characteristics such as
            wave speed.</p>
        <p>Stewart [2] suggested a modification for Charnock expression by
            relating the aerodynamics roughness height to the wave age as
            following:<br/>
            <img src="/static/eng-tools/wind-wave/formula-3.PNG" class="img-polaroid" width="50%"/>
        </p>
        <p>Where <span class="formula">C<sub>p</sub></span> is the peak phase speed of the ocean wave, and <span class="formula">(C<sub>p</sub> / u<sub>*</sub>)</span> is the wave age.
        </p>
        <p>The A and B coefficients in Stewart expression are given different values in different studies.</p>
        <p>The engineering toolkit code calculates the aerodynamics roughness height by using both the
            Charnock expression and the one suggested by Stewart and compared between them. The coefficients,
            A and B are given different values [3] depending on five different references as in table 1:</p>

        <p>The calculated aerodynamic roughness is then used in equation (1) to calculate the velocity at the turbine hub height, which is needed to estimate the power output from the turbine.</p>
        <p>The turbine power output is calculated as following:<br/>
            <img src="/static/eng-tools/wind-wave/formula-4.PNG" class="img-polaroid" width="50%"/>
        </p>
        <p>Where the air density is taken to be 1.225, the energy pattern 1.91 (Rayleigh distribution), and the swept area is calculated depending on the turbine diameter.</p>
