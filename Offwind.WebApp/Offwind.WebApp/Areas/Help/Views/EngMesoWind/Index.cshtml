        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>With this tool you can perform initial estimation of the local wind flow, in order to start designing a preliminary offshore wind farm layout.</p>
        <p>Here some existing databases of meteorological data were adopted to provide fast and convenient access to them.</p>
        <p><strong>Databases included here:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>FNL/GFS</li>
            <li>MERRA</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These databases were processed in the following way to be used here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>identified the points of interest to limit the database to the
                areas where the OFFWIND project is useful, i.e. areas on the planet where
                off-shore wind farms can feasibly be implemented;</li>
            <li>extraction of data to these locations;</li>
            <li>processing of the extracted data to arrive at manageable condensed statistics.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <a id="fnl-gfs"></a>
        <h2>FNL/GFS</h2>
        <p>FNL/GFS database provides meteorological data on a 1º resolution grid. Thus the selection of points was also restricted to this grid.</p>
        <p>As such, 7023 points of interest were identified based on two criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>sea depth below 200m (3512 points, blue dots in the figure);</li>
            <li>proximity to the coast below 1º (3493 points, red points in the figure).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The database contains planetary snapshots of the atmosphere as predicted by the GFS model, at 4 times per day (at 0000, 0600, 1200, 1800),
            since September 1999. Some data assimilation exists, but it is an <em>analysis</em> dataset, not a <em>reanalysis</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once all points of interest were identified, FNL/GFS wind data was extracted at each point, for the period 2000-2011. That is,
            a 12-year time series with wind data at every 6 hours. Extracted data consists of wind velocities and direction at 1000
            millibar pressure. In a standard atmosphere, this corresponds to 111m above sea level, though the actual height will vary
            during the time series.
        </p>
        <p>
            The time series produced by the extraction utility (7523 series, one per point of interest, 840KB each) are converted into <strong>TAB format</strong> (frequency domain)
            which contain, in a tabular form, <em>wind direction frequency</em>, <em>mean wind speeds</em> and <em>velocity histograms</em>.

        <a id="merra"></a>
        <h2>MERRA</h2>
        <p>While FNL has a 1º resolution both in latitude and longitude, MERRA has 0.5º in latitude and 2/3º in longitude.</p>
        <p>TAB files for all the MERRA points are at depths lower than 200m and distances to coast below 1 degree.</p>
        
        <a id="usage"></a>
        <h2>Usage Tips</h2>
        <p>On database page you can work with points in databases. View, search and import them by using map or Search dialog.</p>
        <h5>Clusters</h5>
        <p>
            Due to some technical restrictions, all points are not shown at once
            (doing that will severely load your browser). Instead, these points are grouped into clusters.
            Cluster shows a number of points it contains and it's size and density visually changes
            depending on current map scaling.
        </p>
        <p>
            <div class="cluster_sample">119</div>
            - this is an example of cluster that has 119 points grouped in it.
        </p>
        <h5>Points</h5>
        <p>
            Points - are the basic units that database contain. It directly corresponds to a physical location on earth defined by
            coordinates - Latitude and Longitude.
        </p>

            - this is an example of point.
